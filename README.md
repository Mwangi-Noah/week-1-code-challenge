1. PROJECT TITLE
    Week 1 Code Challenge
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This repository holds three simple javascript codes for the first week code challenge at Moringa School. 
The first javascript code is for a program that prompt the user to input student marks and then output the grades for these inputs. In this challenge, I created two codes. The first code outputs the grade after each input. The grades are collected from the user and immediately filtered through the grading criteria. The second code I wrote first collects all the marks, stores them in an array. The grading criteria is then carried out and the grades stored in another array. It is this array that is used as an output displaying all the subjects, their marks and finally their grades.
The second code is for a program that takes the speed of a car as input and gives the driver a demerit for every 5km/s above the accepted speed limit of 70km/s (quite a fast car indeed). The code for this challenge was a straight forward if else loop to check the speed limit and assign demerits if warranted.
The final code was to calculated the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and the net salary. Despite being too wordy and work intensive, the program itself was quite straight forward and also made use of the if...else loop.
